# Handling _Medium_ Data 

> Explorations on handling data in Python and R

Pandas and R both struggle with _medium_ sized data. You may be asking what specifications differentiate small, medium, and big data. The lines are blurry as the size of the data increases and compute abilities improve.  

- __Small:__ The data that comes [embeded in R](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/00Index.html) or Python packages like [vega-datasets](https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/). 
- __Medium:__ Any dataset that puts a stress on the users memory and compute constraints.
- __Big:__ Any data that requires compute, storage, and memory beyond that availabe to standard local compute capabilities. [This Mac Pro](https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/12/10/21003636/apple-mac-pro-price-most-expensive-processor-ram-gpu) is not standard yet.
